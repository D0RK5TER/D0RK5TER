### The take-aways

*I’m a Software Engineer with 5+ years experience owning a café. I’ve always had a love for technology but in recent years, hardware turned to software and now I am feeling good about both. It is time for me to turn it into my next profession. If you want to talk theory, code, or just life, I am always game!
